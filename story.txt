It's a Wonderful Life

Once upon a time there lived a simple man that wished for more success. The reason he wanted to be more succesfull is that he was surrounded by people who he saw 
as happier, better off people. This made him feel inadequate, and sometimes worthless. How had he, such a gifted individual end up like this while others
prospered. All because he was too kind to sell his soul to the private sector and make more money. However, after a long journy he relized an amazing fact. That 
he had indeed been succesfull. He had helped others, imporved peoples lives, and he had a loving wife and children. In fact, he was the reason that the people around
him were also successful. After relizing this he no longer felt incomplete, if fact he felt that he was living a Wonderful Life. This made him... 
decide to organize a local fair.

As a kid he had always felt happiest at state and county fairs. Nothing could compare to the raw joy and thrills of cotton candy, corn dogs, cheese curds, rollercoasters, and farm animals that fairs offered to anyone willing to pay the entry fee. After realizing that his life was so wonderful, he wanted to give everyone in his community an equally wonderful feeling of happiness and satisfaction in their lives. However, things didn't quite go as planned.

Everything was going so perfectly, until an alert appeared on his television. "The entire state is now in lockdown being immediately. All residents are ordered to shelter in place to stop the spread of Covid-19." He was shaken. All his fond memories quickly faded, leaving him with only dread.
